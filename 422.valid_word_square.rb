    title:
        422. Valid Word Square (easy)

    links:
        https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-square/

    approach:
        matrix iteration approach

    time: O(nm)
        There are n number of string of length m. 

    space: O(1)

    note:
        word_num representing the number of row and column of the current word
        char_pos represents the index of the current character of the word_num
        iterating over word_num from 0 to words.length - 1. we check that 

        1. if the char_pos is bigger than column word
        2. if the word_num is bigger than row word
        3. if char at index don't match
        
        we return false otherwise true at the end.
