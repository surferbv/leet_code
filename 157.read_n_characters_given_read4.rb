# 157. Read N Characters Given Read4 (easy)
#
# TIL:
# Read the problem out loud?
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4/
# The read4 API is already defined for you.
# Below is an example of how the read4 API can be called.
# file = File.new("abcdefghijk") File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
# buf4 = [' '] * 4 Create buffer with enough space to store characters
# read4(buf4) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['a','b','c','d'], fp points to 'e'
# read4(buf4) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['e','f','g','h'], fp points to 'i'
# read4(buf4) # read4 returns 3. Now buf = ['i','j','k',...], fp points to end of file

# @param {List[str]} buf
# @param {int} n
# @return {int}

    buf approach

    time: O(n)
        to copy n characters.

    space: O(1)
        to keep a buf4 of at most four elements. 

    note:
        Could not solve this the problem was difficult to understand. Redo
