    approach: 
        binary search approach

    time: O(log n)

    space: O(1)
        
    note:
        trick is to use binary search and to keep checking for smaller values even if you find one that matches.

    til:
        binary search can be modifed to search all possible values depending on the conditions. 
        forgot to left + right not right - left doh!
